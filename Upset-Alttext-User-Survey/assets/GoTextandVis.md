        <h2>UpSet Introduction</h2>
        This UpSet plot shows game of thrones characters and their identities. A character can have multiple identities (houses, gender, killing condition,etc.). The sets are identities. The items are game of thrones characters. The intersections show how many characters have exactly the same identities.
        <h2>Dataset Properties</h2>
        <p>The dataset contains 20 sets and 238 elements, of which 7 sets are shown in the plot.</p>
        <h2>Set Properties</h2>
        <p>The set sizes are diverging a lot, ranging from 5 to 38. The largest set is male with 38 elements, followed by royal with 24, Stark with 17, Baratheon with 17, female with 14, Targaryen with 13, and Lannister with 5.</p>
        <h2>Intersection Properties</h2>
        <p>The plot is sorted by size in ascending order. There are 22 non-empty intersections, all of which are shown in the plot. The largest 5 intersections are the empty intersection (17), Just male (13), Just female (8), Just Stark (7), and male, and Stark (6).</p>
        <h2>Statistical Information</h2>
        <p>The average intersection size is 4, and the median is 4. The 90th percentile is 8, and the 10th percentile is 1. The largest set, male, is present in 59.1% of all non-empty intersections. The smallest set, Lannister, is present in 9.1% of all non-empty intersections.</p>
        <h2>Trend Analysis</h2>
        <p>The intersection sizes start from a value of 1 and then drastically rise up to 17. The empty intersection is present with a size of 17. An all set intersection is not present. The individual set intersections are in medium and large intersections. The low degree set intersections lie in small and medium sized intersections. No high order intersections are present.</p>
