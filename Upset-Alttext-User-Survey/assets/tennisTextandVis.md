        <h2>UpSet Introduction</h2>
        This UpSet plot shows tennis grand slam tournaments and their winners. A winner can win multiple tournaments. The sets are grand slam tournaments. The items are grand slam winners. The intersections show how many winners won exactly the same tournaments.
        <h2>Dataset Properties</h2>
        <p>The dataset contains 4 sets and 208 elements, of which 4 sets are shown in the plot.</p>
        <h2>Set Properties</h2>
        <p>The set sizes are roughly equal, ranging from 42 to 58. The largest set is Australian Open with 58 elements, followed by French Open with 56, US Open with 52, and Wimbledon with 42.</p>
        <h2>Intersection Properties</h2>
        <p>The plot is sorted by size in descending order. There are 15 non-empty intersections, all of which are shown in the plot.

The individual set intersections are in large and largest intersections. The low degree set intersections lie in small and medium sized intersections. The medium degree set intersections can be seen among small sized intersections. Among the large sized intersections, the high order set intersections are significantly present.</p>
