        <h2>Dataset Properties</h2>
        <p>The dataset contains 17 sets and 6303 elements, of which 8 sets are shown in the plot.</p>
        <h2>Set Properties</h2>
        <p>The set sizes are diverging a lot, ranging from 106 to 1603. The largest set is Drama with 1603 elements, followed by Comedy with 1200, Action with 503, Thriller with 492, Romance with 471, Horror with 343, SciFi with 276, and Mystery with 106.</p>

        <h2>Trend Analysis</h2>
        <p>The intersection sizes peak at a value of 993 and then drastically flatten down to 1. The empty intersection is present with a size of 367. An all set intersection is not present. The individual set intersections are in largest and large intersections. The low degree set intersections lie in small and large and medium sized intersections. The medium degree set intersections can be seen among small sized intersections. Among the small sized intersections, the high order set intersections are significantly present.</p>
