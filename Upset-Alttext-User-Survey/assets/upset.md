# What Is UpSet?

UpSet visualizes set data, as it would usually be displayed in a Venn diagram. However, unlike Venn diagrams, UpSet works for more than three sets. 


## UpSet Explained

UpSet plots the intersections of a set as a matrix, as shown in the following figure. **Each column corresponds to a set, and bar charts on top show the size of the set. Each row corresponds to an intersection: the filled-in cells show which set is part of an intersection.** Also notice the lines connecting the filled-in cells: they show in which direction you should read the plot:

<br>

Below, you can see examples of how these intersections correspond to the segments in a Venn diagram. The first row in the figure is completely empty â€“ it corresponds to all the elements that are in none of the sets. The green (third) row corresponds to the elements that are only in set B, (not in A or C). The orange (fifth) row represents elements that are shared by sets A and B, but not with C. Finally, the last (violet) row represents the elements shared between all sets.

This layout is great because we can plot the size of the intersections as bar charts right next to the matrix, as you can see in the following example: 

<img style="height: 400px; width: 531.8px" class="centered-image" src="./assets/concept_3_cardinality.svg" alt="Plotting intersection sizes with bars in UpSet.">
<br> 

This makes the size of intersections easy to compare. 

The matrix is also very useful because it can be sorted in various ways. A common way is to sort by size, as shown in the following figure, but it's also possible to sort by degree, or sets, or any other desired sorting.

These are the basics of UpSet! Next, we'll look at an example like the ones you will see in the study. 
 
## Interpreting UpSet Plots

The following UpSet plot shows movie genres as intersecting sets.

### Sets and Set Sizes: 
In this UpSet plot, the genres Drama, Comedy, Thriller, Crime, and Fantasy are the sets. The bars on top indicate that Drama is a large set, but Fantasy is small. 

In the study, **you will be asked to classify this distribution** using your judgment. Are they: 
 * Roughly equal, 
 * Diverging a bit, or 
 * Diverging a lot. 
 
 For this example, the correct answer is "Diverging a lot". 


### Intersection and Intersection Sizes:
In this UpSet plot, there are 20 intersections that are made up of different sets.

You will be asked about the make-up of these intersections. The categories are
* an intersection is made up of **no set**; as shown in the third row with size 854 here (movies that don't have any of the genres shown).
* an intersection can only contain a **single set**, like the largest one (Drama, with 1198 movies)
* an intersection can contain **2-3 sets**, like the "Drama-Comedy" intersection with size 212.
* an intersection can be made up of more than 3 sets, or **many sets**
* Finally, an intersection can contain all sets, which we call an "all-set intersection" (not shown in this example).
