        <h2>UpSet Introduction</h2>
        This UpSet plot shows international organizations and their member countries. A member country can be the part of multiple organizations. The sets are the international organizations. The items are the member countries. The intersections show how many member countries are in exactly the same organizations.
        <h2>Dataset Properties</h2>
        <p>The dataset contains 18 sets and 1745 elements, of which 8 sets are shown in the plot.</p>
        <h2>Set Properties</h2>
        <p>The set sizes are diverging a lot, ranging from 16 to 225. The largest set is UPU with 225 elements, followed by UNESCO with 202, Interpol with 200, WHO with 195, UN with 193, NATO with 33, CICA with 31, and SAARC with 16.</p>
        <h2>Intersection Properties</h2>
        <p>The plot is sorted by size in descending order. There are 20 non-empty intersections, all of which are shown in the plot. The largest 5 intersections are UNESCO, Interpol, WHO, UN, and UPU (117), UNESCO, Interpol, WHO, UN, NATO, and UPU (29), UNESCO, Interpol, WHO, UN, UPU, and CICA (20), Just UPU (18), and UNESCO, Interpol, SAARC, WHO, UN, and UPU (6).</p>
        <h2>Statistical Information</h2>
        <p>The average intersection size is 11, and the median is 2. The 90th percentile is 29, and the 10th percentile is 1. The largest set, UPU, is present in 75.0% of all non-empty intersections. The smallest set, SAARC, is present in 15.0% of all non-empty intersections.</p>
        <h2>Trend Analysis</h2>
        <p>The intersection sizes peak at a value of 117 and then drastically flatten down to 1. Unesco, Interpol, WHO, UN, and UPU is the largest by a factor of 4. The empty intersection is present with a size of 5. An all set intersection is not present. The individual set intersections are large in size. The low degree set intersections lie in medium and small sized intersections. The medium degree set intersections can be seen among medium sized intersections. In largest and large sized intersections, the high order set intersections are significantly present.</p>
