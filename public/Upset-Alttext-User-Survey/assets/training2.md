## UpSet Introduction
This UpSet plot shows movies and their genres. A movie can have multiple genres. The sets are movie genres. The items are movies. The intersections show how many movies have exactly the same genres.

## Dataset Properties
The dataset contains 17 sets and 6303 elements, of which 5 sets are shown in the plot.

## Set Properties
The set sizes are diverging a lot, ranging from 68 to 283. The largest set is Adventure with 283 elements, followed by War with 143, Documentary with 127, Mystery with 106, and Fantasy with 68.

## Intersection Properties
The plot is sorted by size in descending order. There are 10 non-empty intersections, all of which are shown in the plot. The largest 5 intersections are Just Adventure (233), Just War (129), Just Documentary (126), Just Mystery (103), and Fantasy, and Adventure (35).

## Statistical Information
The average intersection size is 67, and the median is 33. The 90th percentile is 233, and the 10th percentile is 1. The largest set, Adventure, is present in 40.0% of all non-empty intersections. The smallest set, Fantasy, is present in 30.0% of all non-empty intersections.

## Trend Analysis
The intersection sizes peak at a value of 233 and then drastically flatten down to 1. Just Adventure is the largest by a factor of 2. An all set intersection is not present. The individual set intersections are in largest and large and medium intersections. The low degree set intersections lie in small and medium sized intersections. No high order intersections are present.
